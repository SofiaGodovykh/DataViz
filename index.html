        <div>
            <p>It is widely known that the gender pay gap persists, reflecting the difference</p>
            <p>in earnings between men and women. However, this disparity can be quite different when comparing,</p>
            <p>men and women with similar education levels and work experience.</p>
            <p>Factors like occupation type, industry, and work hours also contribute to the gap.</p>
            <p>We will explore how these factors influence men and women earnings.</p>
